# 📚 **Colety Family Tree App**

A dynamic, Firebase-powered family tree application that automatically organizes parents, spouses, siblings, and children into a clean generational layout. The app is designed to eventually support public users, allowing anyone to create their own family tree and invite relatives to collaborate.

---

## 🔍 **Overview**

The Colety Family Tree App is a modern web tool for visualizing and managing family relationships. Users can add relatives, edit their information, and instantly see updates reflected in the tree.

The system uses **Firestore** as its database and **modular JavaScript** to generate the tree layout, profile pages, and CRUD operations. Planned features include a **birthday fun-fact API** and **multi-user support**, making the project scalable beyond its original personal purpose.

## ⭐ **Key Features**

### 🌿 **Interactive Family Tree**

Automatically arranges parents, children, siblings, and spouses in a structured grid layout.

### ✏️ **Add, Edit, and Remove People**

All updates sync instantly with Firestore, no server needed.

### 👤 **Dynamic Profile Pages**

Each person has their own page generated by URL parameters and live Firestore lookups.

### 🧩 **Modular JavaScript Structure**

`helpers.js`, `tree.js`, and CRUD modules keep the logic organized and easy to expand.

### 🎉 **Birthday Fun-Fact API (In Development)**

Planned integration to show trivia or history based on a user’s birthdate.

### 🌐 **Public-Ready Architecture**

Designed to evolve into a system where anyone can create and share their own family tree.
